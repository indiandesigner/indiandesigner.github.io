											<b>Non-Affiliation</b>: Indian Designer is an independent organization and is not affiliated with any other organization, educational institution, or design college. We operate autonomously, utilizing our own expertise, experience, and resources to provide the Service.
											<br><br>											
											<b>No Admission Guarantee</b>: While we strive to assist and guide you through the college application and admissions process, we do not guarantee admission into any design college or educational institution. The final decision regarding admission rests solely with the respective design colleges and their admission committees, based on their own selection criteria and processes.
											<br><br>
											<b>Non-Refundable Fees</b>: All fees or charges paid to Indian Designer for the Service are non-refundable under any circumstances. This includes situations where your college application is unsuccessful, admission is denied, or the Service is terminated by either party. By engaging our Service, you acknowledge and accept this non-refundable policy.
											<br><br>
											<b>Service Scope</b>: The Service provided by Indian Designer includes advice, guidance, and support pertaining to design college and job applications. This may involve reviewing application materials, providing feedback, conducting mock interviews, and sharing general information about the admissions process. It is important to note that the ultimate responsibility for the application lies with you, the client.
											<br><br>
											<b>Confidentiality</b>: Indian Designer maintains strict confidentiality regarding all personal information shared during the provision of the Service. We adhere to applicable data protection laws and implement reasonable measures to ensure the security and privacy of your information.
											<br><br>
											<b>Liability Limitation</b>: While we endeavor to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we shall not be held liable for any errors, omissions, or discrepancies in the information provided during the Service. Furthermore, we disclaim any responsibility for any direct or indirect damages or losses arising from your use of the Service or reliance on the information provided.
											<br><br>
											<b>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</b>: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Any disputes arising from or in connection with the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of India.
											<br><br>
											<b>Severability</b>: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
											<br><br>
